<h1> Information </h1>
<p>Hey folks, this repository is a remake of my prior <a href="https://github.com/nishi7409/ClanLabs-OpenSourced">ClanLabs-OpenSourced</a> opensourced project.  Unlike the previous source code that users had to work with, this is by far an easier project to setup on your own machine!

Clan Labs' features are pretty neat; however, I don't like to see a community <i>suffer</i> by paying for services that should honestly be open sourced for the entire community. There are other clients that can do the same things as Clan Labs for absoultely free, but you can't see their source code--which sucks.  <strong>So here I am, recreating Clan Labs, for free!</strong>  ðŸ™ƒ
